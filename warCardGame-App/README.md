Overview
As a software engineer, I am always seeking opportunities to refine my programming skills and explore innovative technologies. 
This project focuses on developing a classic War card game app using Swift and SwiftUI. The app offers an engaging, interactive experience 
where players can compete against a CPU opponent in the timeless card game of War. The gameplay incorporates all the classic rules, 
including handling tied cards with "War" scenarios, making it both nostalgic and entertaining. The app dynamically tracks player and CPU scores, 
ensuring that every round is as competitive as the last. Designed with SwiftUI, the user interface is modern, responsive,
and visually appealing, featuring smooth animations that bring the card-dealing and comparisons to life.

The app’s primary goal is to deliver a seamless gaming experience while honing my skills in Swift programming, 
state management, and implementing game logic. It serves as a practical exploration of SwiftUI’s capabilities
for building interactive and visually engaging applications.

Development Environment
This project was developed using Xcode with Swift and SwiftUI as the primary tools. 
The focus was on leveraging SwiftUI for building the user interface and implementing state management with 
@State variables to ensure real-time updates during gameplay. 
Randomization was used to simulate card dealing, and asynchronous logic was implemented to handle game rules 
and animations.
