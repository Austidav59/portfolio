Overview
As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and explore new technologies. This project is focused on creating a simple blackjack game using JavaScript. The goal of this project was to practice logic-based decision-making, game mechanics, and DOM manipulation within a web environment.

The software is a basic blackjack game where the player is dealt two cards and tries to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. The player can draw additional cards, and the program tracks whether the player wins (gets 21), loses (goes over 21), or can continue the game. It also keeps track of the player's chips, deducting or awarding chips based on the gameâ€™s outcome.
