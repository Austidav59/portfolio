Overview
As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to enhance my programming skills and explore new technologies. This project focuses on creating a simple weather data retrieval and display system using C#. The goal of this project is to practice working with APIs, JSON parsing, and creating interactive console applications.
The software is a basic weather information system where users can input geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to retrieve current weather data for that location. The program fetches weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, weather description, wind speed, and humidity. Users can interactively choose which weather details they want to view. The system converts the temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit for user convenience. This weather data retrieval program simulates a simplified weather app experience, allowing users to quickly access current weather conditions for any location.
